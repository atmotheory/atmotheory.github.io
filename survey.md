  <h2 id="t0">Theory and Experimental Collaborations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Description of a photodegradation of VOC in solution and gas phase. The theoretical description allowed to understand the reactivity differences in the different media.</li>
    <li>As PhD student, I was trained to both experimental and theoretical approaches to obtain kinetic data for reactions of atmospheric interest. As associate professor, I am now only performing molecular simulations for environmental processes in close collaboration with an international research network.</li>
    <li>The collaboration helped us identifying some scientific questions and provided some systems to be studied. Also discussion with experimentalists gives some guidelines for the conditions to be used in the model.</li>
    <li>Theoretical chemistry can help interpret experimental data by providing explanations for complex atmospheric phenomena that might be difficult to observe directly.</li>
    <li>Kinetics and Mechanisms of chemical reactions of atmospheric interest in the gas phase.</li>
    <li>Hydration of molecules of atmospheric interest (alpha and beta pinene, cis-pinonic acid, MBTCA).</li>
    <li>Some insights into possible products of aqueous phase reactions of small organics.</li>
    <li>To clarify the understanding of the processes influencing the changes in the Fe isotopic signature of aerosols during their atmospheric transport, from the source region to the ocean surface, ultimately to serve in external Fe sources assessment modelling.</li>
    <li>I am collaborating with the NBD group in UBC, Vancouver (Canada), where they use their VOCUS set-up to withdraw data on organic selenium species in gas phase, reacting with typical tropospheric oxidants, while I modelize the oxidation processes, to understand synergiticly the selenium atmospheric cycle.</li>
    <li>Expansion of my theoretical research to new fields, such as the study of isotopic fractionation of iron.</li>
    <li>I have done this kind of collaboration on several occasions. Recently, I have been working on experiments with ozonolysis. It has been very useful to have quantum chemistry and master equation modelling in order to interpret the experimental observations leading to excited Criegee intermediate reaction channels.</li>
    <li>In one of my earlier studies, I used quantum chemical calculations to help explain the reactivity patterns of three types of dienes with the OH radical. The theoretical component provided insights into reaction pathways and energy barriers, supporting experimental observations. While the analysis was not deeply extensive from the theoretical side, it marked my first experience integrating computational chemistry with atmospheric reaction kinetics.</li>
    <li>Motivation to theoretically study certain systems of interest for the atmosphere, publications.</li>
    <li>Molecular level description of reactivity occurring between PAHs and water.</li>
    <li>Infrared matrix isolation spectroscopy and theoretical studies of interactions between water and organics with atmospheric interest.</li>

    <li>Nucleation clusters. Confirm the potential of new reaction observed during some lab experiments.</li>
    <li>Interpretation of experimental data (IR spectra).</li>
    <li>I have been working in close collaboration with Prof. Ari Laaksonen and Prof. Athanasios Nenes on developing and parameterizing a deposition freezing model based on innovative theoretical description, also with Prof. Yinon Rudich in explaining experimentally observed stochasticity in freezing on clay surfaces. I am equally collaborating with chemists and experimental biologists on understanding how environmental factors impact the viability of viruses.</li>
    <li>The collaboration was very fruitful in confirming the chemical mechanisms hypothesised from experimental observations.</li>

  <h2 id="t1">Theoretical Chemistry vs Atmospheric Sciences</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Lack of combined workshops, lack of co-funding, unstructured community</li>
    <li>The two communities are not always speaking the same scientific language. We are not a lot of theoretical chemists working with issues related to atmospheric chemistry.</li>
    <li>Here are some key challenges: technical challenges, data limitations, knowledge transfer...</li>
    <li>How to use theoretical chemistry for tackling atmospheric issues?</li>
    <li>Applicability of theoretical results to the complex atmospheric multiphase systems</li>
    <li>Theoretical chemistry focuses on using quantum mechanics and computational methods to explore how molecules behave, react, and interact at the atomic level. It provides detailed insights into reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, and rate constants. Atmospheric sciences, in contrast, study the physical and chemical processes in Earth’s atmosphere, including weather patterns, climate change, and air pollution. The two fields converge in atmospheric chemistry, where theoretical calculations help determine key reaction parameters—such as how pollutants degrade or how radicals like OH interact with atmospheric compounds—feeding into models that predict environmental and climate impacts.</li>
    <li>Improve detection limits to better measure air pollutants. Identify new chemistry processes to measure pollutants (secondary organic aerosol for example) and precursor gases in real-life conditions. Knowing the main issues in atmospheric chemistry for theoretical chemists. Atmospheric chemistry is not really taught in chemistry departments—there's a gap in understanding what the main scientific questions are.</li>
    <li>The characterization of the optimized structures of the Fe complexes in both aqueous solution (simulated cloud water) and on the surface of Fe aerosol particles, and the determination of the geometric structure of the adsorbed complexes, by comparison with experimental ATR-FTIR spectra.</li>
    <li>To better understand the applications/limitations of all the possible tools in each domain, and which skills are needed for which question. Greater care in explaining set-ups and computational methods would be great.</li>
    <li>The systems studied in experiments are very large, making them difficult to treat fully from a quantum mechanical point of view. The conformational landscape is vast.</li>
    <li>We should improve communication between theoreticians, experimentalists, and modellers so that each community is more aware of the challenges affecting the others. But progress requires more than communication—it requires flexibility in research direction.</li>
    <li>The atmosphere includes gas, aerosol, and liquid phases. The interactions between different particles are very complex. Simulating this complexity is challenging. Many atmospheric processes involve highly reactive species that are hard to model and validate. Additionally, real atmospheric reactions occur under non-ideal conditions (temperature, humidity, sunlight, etc.), while theoretical models often assume idealized or isolated systems.</li>
    <li>Same as above (likely a repeated entry).</li>
    <li>The main limitation is the complexity of atmospheric systems, which are very difficult to model precisely.</li>
    <li>We may simply lack shared interests or personal networks sometimes.</li>
    <li>One key limitation is the lack of effective communication and collaboration. Experimental data need theoretical support to explain mechanisms; theory without data lacks grounding.</li>
    <li>Ab initio methods are very difficult to apply to environmental processes, which can span years—far beyond the timescales that current simulations can handle.</li>
    <li>None in my opinion.</li>
    <li>The community of theorists interested in atmospheric chemistry is quite limited in size.</li>
    <li>Not at all. But I have collaborated with chemists as a spectroscopist interested in atmospheric molecules.
      <ul>
        <li>Availability of theoreticians: colleagues I worked with have retired, and there are few theoreticians in France involved in atmospheric chemistry.</li>
        <li>Good personal knowledge of the capabilities and limits of theoretical calculations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Limitations arise from challenges in mutual understanding and the lack of exchange spaces.</li>
    <li>One major limitation is accurately modeling atmospheric reactions under real-world conditions. Differences in timescales, lack of data, and computational demands also hinder integration. Translating theoretical predictions into usable models is still difficult.</li>
    <li>Theoretical chemistry clarifies the molecular causes of environmental phenomena.</li>
    <li>There’s a gap between the complexity of real atmospheric systems and the simpler systems that current simulation techniques can realistically model.</li>
    <li>Theoretical chemistry is still limited to relatively simple systems—especially at interfaces where modeling becomes much more complex.</li>
    <li>Communication is key. Theoretical chemists need specific, answerable questions. Our methods are limited by computational cost, and brute-force reproduction of experiments is usually not feasible.</li>
    <li>The main limitation is the lack of dedicated meetings. This workshop is expected to help fill that gap and encourage new collaborations.</li>
    <li>The biggest challenge in comparing theory and experiment is the difference in size and timescale. Simulated particles are smaller and occur over shorter durations than what’s observed experimentally.</li>

    <li>Accurately modeling complex chemical reactions that occur in the atmosphere...</li>
    <li>Station for calculations</li>
    <li>I am not knowledgeable enough to have an opinion on this (hopefully after the workshop!)</li>
    <li>Understanding the kinetics in water droplets and aerosols...</li>
    <li>Computational power? Link between microscopic and macroscopic</li>
    <li>Chemistry at interfaces (different phases)</li>
    <li>Limitations in terms of the fraction of atmospheric systems that can be modelled...</li>
    <li>To my opinion, the most pressing scientific challenges are 1/ interface processes; 2/ investigation of non-equilibrium chemistry processes</li>
    <li>It is important to narrow the gap between experience and high-level modeling.</li>

  <h2 id="t5">What are your impressions of the nexus of theoretical and atmospheric chemistry as an emerging topic?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>There is definitely a large room to explore, especially for the development of new theories and simulation protocols to solve atmospheric chemistry problems.</li>
    <li>I think the connection between theoretical and atmospheric chemistry is becoming more important than ever... especially for things like reactive intermediates or multiphase chemistry that are hard to study otherwise.</li>
    <li>To the best of my knowledge, the link between theoretical and atmospheric chemistry started after the NIST conference in Gaithersburg in 1992... This is not an emerging topic but it should be important to have more people involved with skills in both areas.</li>
    <li>The link between theoretical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry is an exciting and fast-emerging field, with enormous potential for advancing our understanding of atmospheric processes.</li>
    <li>I strongly believe this is a hot topic.</li>
    <li>This is an interesting approach to combine both to tackle real-world problems.</li>
    <li>Natural collaboration.</li>
    <li>Mandatory if one wants to contribute to the science-based efforts in the fight against climate change consequences.</li>
    <li>This is not emerging, it has to be reinforced.</li>
    <li>Very good impressions, very important to study and include for our understanding of several aspects in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in different phases (e.g. air/water).</li>
    <li>I don't see it as an emerging topic in general... not much progress has been made to apply theoretical methods to multiphase systems since even the aqueous bulk system cannot be easily represented by quantum chemistry.</li>
    <li>The nexus of theoretical and atmospheric chemistry is an exciting and increasingly essential area of research... making the intersection not just emerging, but foundational to future advancements in atmospheric science.</li>
    <li>I'm sure that this is an essential step towards meeting the environmental challenges we face... it is vital that the various experts are better equipped to deal with them.</li>
    <li>Should be promoted.</li>
    <li>I have the impression that significant progress has perhaps been made in describing gas-phase phenomena, but that there is still progress to be made with condensed phases (e.g., particles/atmospheric water).</li>
    <li>Science in general should aim to explain to its best capacity what it is doing, and using those two tools conjointly should be mandatory now to deliver as complete an answer as possible to any relevant scientific question.</li>
    <li>It should be encouraged, maybe via a GDR.</li>
    <li>Atmospheric chemistry is an extremely challenging subject... we should continue to improve structure-activity relationships with experimental and theoretical insights.</li>
    <li>Win-win situation: they could complement each other but are sometimes necessary on emerging topics.</li>
    <li>I think the connection between theoretical and atmospheric chemistry is becoming more and more important... working together is the key to making progress in atmospheric chemistry.</li>
    <li>Highly interesting and essential for gaining a deeper understanding of molecular-scale processes.</li>
    <li>It’s a very promising area. Combining theory with atmospheric studies can improve our understanding of complex chemical processes in the environment.</li>
    <li>There is great potential for theoretical chemistry to help understand the atmospheric domain.</li>
    <li>To me it seems really promising!</li>
    <li>Theoretical chemistry should emerge as a routine tool for atmospheric chemistry, with well-characterized standard methods, strengths, and limitations.</li>
    <li>My impression is that this topic is not new, but the communities are growing, and they need to meet. Ideally, the workshop will generate new projects with new ideas and emerging topics.</li>
    <li>It is timely due to the increased computational power, which allows for better methodological accuracy and more complex modeling approaches.</li>
